# 📉 Analyzing Return Rates at the Superstore: A Data Storytelling Project

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying and visualizing the root causes of product returns at a major retail superstore. Using Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard and crafted a data-driven story aimed at helping the CEO reduce the volume of returned orders.

This project was completed as part of **Sprint 5: Storytelling with Data** in the **Business Intelligence Analytics Bootcamp** by TripleTen.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Returned orders are costly and indicative of deeper customer satisfaction or operational issues. The CEO of the Superstore requested a comprehensive visual analysis to uncover:

- Who is returning items?
- What types of products are most returned?
- When and where returns spike?
- How return trends affect profitability?

## 📁 Data Source

- **Orders Table**: Sales data including product, location, customer, and order details.
- **Returns Table**: Linked to the Orders Table using a LEFT JOIN.
- Calculated Field: `Returned` (Yes = 1, Null = 0) used to derive return metrics.
