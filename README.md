# Data_projects_TripleTen
Portfolio of completed projects I worked on while attending the Buisness Intelligence Analytics TripleTen Bootcamp.

| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | [Fresh Beats Data](https://github.com/aprilstrathmeyer/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Fresh%20Beats%20) | In this project, I analyzed data and pre-built visualizations to create a stakeholder-ready report for Fresh Beats, an online music platform focused on streaming and artist promotion. The report provided key insights into artist promotion effectiveness, user engagement, and genre-based recommendations to enhance the visibility of emerging musicians and increase user conversions. Based on the findings, I developed actionable recommendations to optimize promotional strategies, improve user experience, and support business growth. |
| 2 | [vacation rental market](https://github.com/aprilstrathmeyer/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/vacation%20rental%20market) | In this project, I analyzed Airbnb data to help a client identify the most profitable property types and neighborhoods for vacation rentals in Manhattan. Using pivot tables and data cleaning techniques in spreadsheets, I uncovered that 1-bedroom apartments in neighborhoods like Harlem, Hell's Kitchen, and the Lower East Side are particularly attractive based on recent reviews. I also estimated potential annual revenue for top listings, providing actionable investment recommendations backed by data-driven insights. |
| 3 | [SQl rideshare company insights](https://github.com/aprilstrathmeyer/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/SQl%20rideshare%20company%20insights) | In this project, I worked as a data analyst for Zuber, a ride-sharing startup in Chicago, to uncover patterns in taxi usage and evaluate the impact of weather on ride durations. Using SQL, I analyzed trip, vehicle, and weather data to identify the most active taxi companies and tested a hypothesis on how rainy Saturdays affect travel time between the Loop and O'Hare Airport. The findings provided actionable insights into passenger behavior and external factors, helping Zuber make informed decisions for its market entry strategy. |
| 4 | [Ecommerce company Analyzation](https://github.com/aprilstrathmeyer/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Ecommerce%20company%20Analyzation) | In this project, I analyzed raw user activity logs from an e-commerce website to build a conversion funnel and perform a cohort-based retention analysis. By cleaning and transforming event data, I calculated conversion rates between product views, cart opens, and purchases, and tracked user retention over time based on their first purchase month. The final deliverable included a polished, executive-ready spreadsheet with insights into user behavior and long-term engagement trends. |
| 5 | [Bankruptcy Preventive ](https://github.com/aprilstrathmeyer/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Bankruptcy%20prevenative) | In this project, I used Tableau to analyze the Superstore dataset and identify key drivers of profitability, loss, and customer behavior. I created targeted visualizations to highlight the most and least profitable product combinations, assess the impact of returns, and recommend advertising strategies based on profit potential by state and time of year. The analysis provided clear, data-driven recommendations to improve the store’s operational efficiency and financial performance. |
| 6 | [Follow up on banruptcy (returns)](https://github.com/aprilstrathmeyer/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Follow%20up%20on%20banruptcy%20(returns)) | In this project, I used Tableau to analyze customer return behavior at the Superstore and identify key drivers behind returned orders. I created a series of visualizations—such as scatterplots, maps, and bar charts—to explore correlations between returns and factors like geography, time, product categories, and customer patterns. The final dashboard presents actionable insights for reducing return rates and includes a guided story to help stakeholders interpret the data and make informed business decision |
| 7 | [Shopify comments & reveiws](https://github.com/aprilstrathmeyer/Data_projects_TripleTen/tree/main/Shopify%20comments%20%26%20reveiws) | In this Power BI project, I analyzed the Shopify App Store to identify key trends and factors contributing to app success. Using data from multiple related tables, I created calculated columns, built relationships, and visualized metrics such as app distribution, review quality, and developer responsiveness. The final report includes insights into which developers are most effective, how user feedback aligns with ratings, and what characteristics are common among top-performing apps.. |
