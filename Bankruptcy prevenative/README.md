# 🏪 Preventative Bankruptcy: Superstore Business Intelligence Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview

In this Business Intelligence Analytics project, I was tasked with diagnosing financial and operational inefficiencies at a struggling retail superstore. Using Tableau and data-driven storytelling, I delivered actionable insights to help the company avoid bankruptcy and improve profitability.

This project was completed as part of Sprint 4 in the Business Intelligence Analytics Bootcamp by TripleTen.
